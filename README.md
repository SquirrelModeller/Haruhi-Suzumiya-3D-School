## Haruhi Suzumiya 3D School

This project is to re-create the high school from the series "Haruhi Suzumiya" - Nishinomiya Kita High School. In doing so all 3D models are 1:1 with the real high school.

Currently the main building of the high school is getting created. Below is an image pulled from Google Maps displaying the real high school which is getting re-created.

The 3D models are simple objects with a low poly count to maximize the performance if imported into a game engine. By instancing repeating objects like classrooms, windows, hallways etc. the batch calling and usage of VRAM is minimized to increase the performance (FPS, loading times). Thereby increasing the development time of the project to make sure that the final 3D files released are on a professional standard to which everyone can easily import and use.

The project is being made in the open-source program [Blender](https://blender.org).

Take a look in updates to see the current issues that need resolving.

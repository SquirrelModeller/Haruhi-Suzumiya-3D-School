                    The re-creation of the high school from the anime “The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya”(涼宮ハルヒの憂鬱) -
                    Nishinomiya Kita High School.<br /><br />
                    This re-creation is a 1:1 3D model from exterior to interior. See the wiki for
                    information about the 3D model, layout and history of the school.<br /><br />
                    The 3D models are released under the Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal license free to use for
                    any
                    project, commercial too. Take a look at the license to see what you are allowed to do with the
                    assets.<br /><br />
                    Drag the middle of the white line to compare the real life school to the 3D model.

                    The 3D models are simple objects with a low poly count to maximize the performance. By instancing
                    repeating objects like classrooms, windows, hallways etc. the batch calling and usage of VRAM is
                    minimized to increase the performance (FPS, loading times).
                    <br /><br />
                    This optimization increases the development time of the project, in order to make sure that the
                    final 3D files released are on a professional standard to which everyone can easily import and use.
                    <br /><br />
                    The project is being made in the open-source program Blender.
                    <br /><br />
                    Take a look in "Projects" on the Github page to see the current issues that need resolving. Feel
                    free to submit an issue
                    if there is a problem with a 3D model, copyright or other reason.
                    <br /><br />
                    If you wish to support the development, having confidence in your 3D skills, you are welcome to
                    request joining the project. In which case, make sure you read the "contributing" on Guthub and
                    agree to the
                    terms.
